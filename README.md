# GPUPathTracer
GPU Path Tracer written in C++ with CUDA and OpenGL for the DH2323 course project at KTH.

## Project report

The project report file [project.pdf](https://github.com/henrikdahlberg/GPUPathTracer/blob/master/report.pdf) describes the steps taken and theory behind the project. Since writing the report I have added the parallel Morton code-based BVH builder by Tero Karras.
